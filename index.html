Furthermore, no prior knowledge is required. Going to university, which is also the traditional route, <b>is not</b> the only way to get your foot into the sector, as there are resources and training providers worth approaching, depending on the individual, as to whether they are independent learners or taught-style learners.
            The resources and training providers, highly recommended are:

        <h2> What is Python? </h2>
        <p>
            <b>Python</b> is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
            Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. 
            Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

            Python is one of the most common programming languages used by majoritity of industries in the tech and IT sector, and gaining knowleddge of this language would enable the individual to accomplish different things, such as data analytics, machine learning and design.
            On the other hand, HTML is the language used for web development, and insight into HTML would enable an individual to build websites, which is a skill well sought after by numerous companies. 
            Therefore, the understanding of both languages, would be extremely advantageous for the employment market created by the tech sector.
